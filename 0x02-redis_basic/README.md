# Redis Cache Project

This project implements a simple caching mechanism using Redis. The `Cache` class allows for the storage of various data types (string, bytes, int, float) in a Redis database, identified by unique keys.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- Redis installed and running

## Usage

To use the `Cache` class, import it into your main application and create an instance. You can store data by calling the `store` method.
